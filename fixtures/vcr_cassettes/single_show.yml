        Felicity Smoak and the occasional, reluctant assistance of former police detective,
        now beat cop, Quentin Lance, Oliver has been waging a one-man war on crime.</p>","updated":1474019912,"_links":{"self":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/shows/4"},"previousepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/647412"},"nextepisode":{"href":"http://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/836110"}}}'
